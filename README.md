# Characters
## _Be whoever you want_

Characters is a plugin that allows you to set up a characters system for your players with very customizable features!
Perfect for role-play servers

- version: 1.19.4 (no NMS usage was included in the making of this)
- highly customizable
- persistent throughout players

> `/characters` - Opens the characters gui where you can select your identity!

> `/createcharacter` - Allows the individual to create characters!

> `/character <player>` - Shows you what character another player is playing!

> `/setcharacterage <player> [character-id] [new-age]` - Allows players with permission `character.change.age` to change another player's character age

## Character slots limit (default limit is 2 slots)
 `wardrobe.slots.three` - maximum of 3 character slots

 `wardrobe.slots.four` - maximum of 4 character slots

 `wardrobe.slots.six` - maximum of 6 character slots

## PlaceholderAPI
`%character_name%`, `%character_description%`, `%character_age%`

## Caveats
 Players without the permission `character.age.restriction` will have an age-setting restriction of 21.

 This plugin can't operate on offline players, meaning you won't be able to access/see an offline player's character.

 This plugin hasn't been tested on versions except 1.19.4, but no NMS usage was included as said above, so there is a high chance it works with other versions aswell!

 No one can have more than 6 characters at max, even with the highest `wardrobe.slots.six` permission.
